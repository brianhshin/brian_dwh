## Draft Kings HRIS ETL Project ##

I was approached by the DE team at Draft Kings to work on a free-lance project to revamp their HRIS data, as they moved to mature it from ad hoc google sheets to something more scalable. I put together this plan to detail the steps I would take. ALthough they ended up going with another candidate, we ended up having some great conversations about my plan, their tech stack, in an overall pleasant exchange!
