Hi, my name is Brian Shin, and this is where I will be sharing some projects I'm working on for both fun and learning purposes. You can contact me at brianhesungshin@gmail.com or ony [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-shin-43b72984/) if you have any questions!

So far, I've spent most of my time on my [codwarzone](https://github.com/brianhshin/brian_dwh/codwarzone) project, so feel free to take a look :).
